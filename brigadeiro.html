    <p>
        <i>A very traditional Brazilian dessert that is present in every Brazilian birthday party! Delicious and super easy to make.</i>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One can of condensed milk.</li>
        <li>Three or four spoons of chocolate powder or cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>One spoon of butter (Actual butter and preferably unsalted. No margarine!)</li>
        <li>Sprinkles (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients into a pan.</li>
        <li>Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) until it stops sticking to the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Remove it from the pan and eat it with a spoon or roll it into small balls.</li>
        <li>If you chose to roll it into balls, you may also roll them around in sprinkles while still hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Closing remarks</h2>
    <p>Depending on how much brigadeiro you want to make, youâ€™ll have to add more or less of each ingredient, so be creative! Be careful with the chocolate powder, you definitely do not want to add too much of it!</p>
